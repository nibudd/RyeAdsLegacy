	<h3>About</h3>
	<p>
		RyeAds is a classified ads website specifically for the students and faculty of Ryerson University in Toronto, Ontario.
		It's an ongoing project produced by Nathan Budd, one of Ryerson's very own engineering students. It's Nathan's goal
		that the community of Ryerson University will find this site as beneficial as he believes it can be - becoming 
		the first place students look for used books, places to rent, and a lot more.
